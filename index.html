          <p>
            Hey there! I’m a high school student on a mission to conquer
            everything from tech to fitness (and everything in between). While
            most people are figuring out what they want to do, I’m diving
            headfirst into everything—because why limit yourself? I’m obsessed
            with building things, especially those that scream "function over
            form." Whether it's websites, apps, or frameworks, Im all about
            creating solutions that actually work, not just look pretty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a polymath is my unofficial job title. I’ll try anything once
            (or twice), and if I like it, I’ll dive in deeper. I’ve dabbled in
            startups (yes, I founded a couple), built websites for orphanage,
            schools, and even cooked up a workout tracking app for my
            calisthenics routine. On that note, if I’m not buried in code,
            you’ll find me hanging off a pull-up bar or figuring out how to
            human flag—it’s all about balance, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let’s talk about the real fun: coding. Some people binge-watch
            Netflix—I binge-watch coding tutorials. Debugging is my version of a
            mental workout, and I get oddly excited when I finally squash a bug
            that’s been haunting my dreams. Computer science isn’t just a
            passion; it’s an addiction. I eat, sleep, and breathe algorithms,
            and I’m always on the lookout for the next challenge to tackle, be
            it through an internship, freelance gig, or just a fun side project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, math has a special place in my heart too. I’m that person
            who genuinely enjoys solving equations like it’s a puzzle (yeah, I’m
            weird like that). Math is my secret weapon in everything I do—from
            coding to life decisions. It’s all about breaking down complex
            problems into bite-sized pieces, then attacking them with precision.
            Throw in some machine learning and AI internships, and I’m well on
            my way to mastering the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, I’m all about staying busy, learning fast, and having fun
            while doing it. Whether it’s working on a new project, founding a
            startup, or casually winning a silver medal in state-level karate
            (no big deal), I’m always pushing myself to the next level. So, if
            you’re ready to solve the next big problem together—or just want to
            geek out over algorithms—let’s connect!

                I am the founder of Student Productivity Hub, a startup
                currently in development, aimed at enhancing student
                productivity with innovative tools and motivational features. My
                role involves managing social media marketing, running ads, and
                ensuring the site becomes profitable. We are working on
                integrating essential tools like a Pomodoro timer, calendar
                integration, and task management system to help students
                organize their time efficiently. A unique feature in development
                is a live counter of the student's age, which will visually
                display the remaining time in life based on the birthdate input,
                aiming to inspire students to make the most of their time.
                Additionally, we plan to integrate a notes collection system
                that allows students to volunteer and share study materials,
                promoting a collaborative learning environment. The goal is to
                provide a comprehensive productivity solution that motivates and
                supports students throughout their academic journey.

            curiosity and desire to master multiple domains. I've had the chance
            to dive into three internships, each in a completely different

                During my internship, I worked on a project called Florascope,
                aimed at using AI to identify diseases in potato plants. The
                idea for the project was born out of a science fair, where I
                initially developed a prototype system that could recognize
                plant diseases based on image data. Seeing the potential impact
                of this tool for farmers, I decided to expand on the project by
                collaborating with an experienced machine learning engineer to
                refine the model.
              </p>
              <p>
                The primary goal of the project was to build a machine learning
                model capable of analyzing images of potato plants and detecting
                various diseases early, ensuring timely interventions. By
                improving disease identification, we aimed to reduce crop loss
                and improve yields for potato farmers.

                about creating clean, professional, and easy-to-navigate sites
                that showcased the clients' work or services. In some cases, I
                offered these services for free, especially when helping friends

                  I also worked with a steel company to redesign their corporate
                  website. The challenge here was creating a modern, responsive

                  company information. This project helped me learn about

                  aesthetics and functionality to engage their target audience.

                  Another interesting project was developing a website for a

                  resources for potential clients. I focused on creating a
                  welcoming user experience with easy navigation to the service

                  the importance of user-centered design, especially in fields

                  Throughout my freelancing experience, I worked on both paid

                  delivering work on tight deadlines. The free projects, on the
                  other hand, were excellent opportunities to build my portfolio
                  and offer support to individuals or small businesses who

                  In this project, I focused on implementing a fresh front-end
                  design to enhance the site's appearance. I ensured the website
                  looked great on any device by making it responsive for mobile,
                  tablet, and desktop.

                  One of the biggest challenges was speeding up the site, which
                  initially suffered from slow load times. The slowness was due
                  to bulky images and unoptimized code, which significantly
                  impacted performance.

                <li class="work-item">
                  I tackled this by adding lazy loading for images and minifying
                  CSS and JavaScript to optimize load speed. Working with the
                  design team and school staff was a highlight, as their
                  insights aligned with real needs.

                  A fellow team member helped me understand Wigal's standards
                  and guided me through solving tricky issues. I learned
                  firsthand how crucial good communication is—it helps avoid
                  misunderstandings and wasted time.

                  The feedback I received was encouraging. My supervisors
                  praised my problem-solving and quick learning. This internship
                  deepened my passion for web development and directed me toward
                  becoming a full-stack developer.

                  It also gave me a solid understanding of how tech teams work,
                  which I’m excited to apply in future projects.
